Mathematics and physics are subjects that have always fascinated me. Understanding how the world works and solve increasingly complex problems is fascinating. The whole thing is based on a logical reasoning, a certain form of imagination and a particular vision that I particularly like.

I started computer science in 5e grade by learning many languages on my own: I needed it to help me develop my projects and I understood later that this tool was essential to physics and mathematics: Euclid's algorithm is a perfect example, because although it is easily usable on paper, its transposition into computer science makes it much more efficient.

The MP2I are excellent courses in my preferred fields. By joining your CPGE, I will finally have an intensive rhythm that corresponds to my level and my expectations.

I want to do this preparatory classes in your excellent school because I want to do mathematical research (generation of prime numbers) and computer science (creation of recommendation algorithms that do not lock users into a filter bubble). For this, I plan to become a normalien, and the best way to do this is to join your school.
