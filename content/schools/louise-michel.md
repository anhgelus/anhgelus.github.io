After my middle school, I entered in 2nd at Louise-Michel high school, in Gisors.

I have decided to follow the mathematics, physics & chemistry and NSI (computer science) specialities during my 1er.

When I went from the first to the last grade, I have chosen to stop the NSI because it was pretty annoying to take the 
courses at home (my high-school did not have any professor of NSI).
I also take the option "mathematics expert" which is perfect when we want to improve our understanding of this beautiful 
science.
