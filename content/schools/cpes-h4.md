The CPES Science (Cycle Pluridisciplinaire d’Études Supérieures en Science) is for students who are interested in scientific
research.
It is a great way to discover the world of research and to get a taste of what it is like to be a researcher.

Henri IV in Paris is one of the best high-school in France, and it has the best CPES in France.

The CPES at Henri IV was made in collaboration with PSL (Paris Science et Lettres), the best university in France.
During this cycle, we have some courses at the engineer school MINES PSL, university Paris Dauphine-PSL, and ENS-Ulm.
