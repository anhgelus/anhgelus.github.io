My personal blog! It's powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org), a powerful open-source blogging platform. I use it to write
articles about my projects, my experiences and my gaming reviews.

Of course, this blog is dockerized and deployed on my server. I use [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) (a reverse proxy) to
redirect the traffic to the right container.
