Math Libs is a... library implementing what I've learned in the Maths Experts Option (France) into
many languages like java, python, rust and typescript.

The fractions, the complex numbers and the matrix are implemented in Java. For other languages, I'll implement this features
soon (but actually I don't have the time...).
