This is a website for a group of Minecraft creator. They made very ambitious Minecraft event.
They already worked with many french youtubers ands streams like
[MartinPonk](https://www.twitch.tv/martinponk), [Roi_Louis](https://www.youtube.com/user/RoiLouisMC), 
[Nems](https://www.youtube.com/user/NemsWorld), [Vartac](https://www.twitch.tv/vartac),
[Goldawn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1r2mjZaIuAQaP0da2Zsjg) and many more.

It was built with Vanilla JS and PHP. I have just to maintain this website without modifying
it. I had to add the responsiveness and update the text.
