I am William Herg√®s known as Anhgelus Morhtuuzh on Internet and in the French Minecraft community.

I was the chief executive and lead developer from the biggest independant French Minecraft community based on Discord.

Currently, I have no project for a simple reason: I have been accepted in the [CPES Sciences of Henri IV and PSL](https://psl.eu/en/education/multidisciplinary-undergraduate-degree-cpes) (one of France's toughest university courses).

## Skills

I'm a fullstack developer enjoying DevOps and sysadmin.

I like developing with Go and Kotlin. I also know Java, HTML/CSS, JS/TS, PHP and Python.

I enjoy using Vite, Node, Lit and Svelte while working on the frontend of a website.

I like using gorilla/mux, Hugo and Laravel for the backend part.

I am also familiar with lot of other Go and Kotlin technologies.

I enjoy employing SQL database like PostgreSQL, very fast key-value database like Redis and time-series database like InfluxDB.

I usually utilize Docker to containerize my applications to facilitate the deployment process.
