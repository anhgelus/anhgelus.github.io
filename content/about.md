I am William Hergès known as Anhgelus Morhtuuzh on Internet and in the French Minecraft community.

I have the baccalauréat (A-Level and High School Diploma equivalent) with distinction. I am now doing my bachelor of science degree in the fist EU University ([Paris Sciences et Lettres](https://psl.eu/en), known as PSL) and in the most prestigious French high school ([Lycée Henri-IV](https://lycee-henri4.com/) in Paris).

I am interested in mathematics, computer science and philosophy. I really like algebra and I'm the best computer scientist in my class.

I started learning programming languages in 2017. My first was Java. I decided to learn it to modify Minecraft with Bukkit and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

After, I learned web technologies like HTML/CSS and PHP. Later, I tried JS/TS, but I was not convinced due to its dynamic, weak and duck typing.

Between 2022 and 2023, I discovered [Go](https://go.dev/), a programming language developed by Google, and I fall in love with it. I used it everywhere: websites, cli applications and backend softwares.

In 2023, one of my coworker showed me [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and I rediscovered the power of the JVM. With it, I once again enjoyed creating Minecraft plugins and mods. During this year, I also returned to JS/TS with libraries like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Lit](https://lit.dev/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and I like it! 2023 was definitely the year of diversity.

Currently, I am not interested in the websites' creation. I would rather working on backend applications or on softwares.

My latest projects do not focus on the web: I always use a tool to create this part quickly and easily (like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) or [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/writerside/)).
