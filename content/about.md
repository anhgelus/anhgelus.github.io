I'm a developer and a web designer since 2017. I firstly learned plugin development with Bukkit and Java to
modify the game Minecraft.

After, I started the web development with HTML/CSS. My first website was, of course, ugly but now, I have decided
to use a new technology, SASS. SASS is a very powerful technology to automate the CSS creation part. I also learned
Bulma to create website more efficiently.

But the redundant part of creating a website was very annoying, I had to repeat my code so much times. This
is why I have decided to learn PHP. PHP is very useful to create powerful websites with many features and database
requests, Facebook is powered by PHP for example. I also decided to work more efficiently during the development.
So, I learned Laravel to automatise the backend part of the website.

Later, I learned TypeScript and JavaScript to create client-side website like YouTube or Trello. I didn't like
JavaScript because I didn't like the high-level structure of this language. That's why I decided to try TypeScript.
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, so it's as useful as JavaScript but
the developer is not annoyed by this language.

Finally, I learned Go to create very fast and asynchronous websites and Docker to create easily production
environment.

I'm very interested in the web development and the dynamic programming. I love using the power of the mathematics
in my programs to optimize them. The Dynamic Programing is a mix of mathematics and programming, and it's one
of the best way to create optimized application like software or website. For example, I can create a Markdown
parser with this technique.
