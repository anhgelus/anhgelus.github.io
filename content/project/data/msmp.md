[MSMP](https://github.com/msmp-mc) is a new game mode in Minecraft. It combines survival, PvPvE, Semi-RP and maze. 

I was the leader of MSMP and I worked with Kotlin to create custom plugin modifying the Minecraft generation (replacing the default generation by the generation of a procedural maze) and Go to create a CLI app generating maze.
