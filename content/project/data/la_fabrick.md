[La FaBrick](https://la-fabrick.eu/) is an association of event creators. They create large event on Minecraft such as completly remade Cit√© or reimagined Balls Of Steel.

They already worked with many french youtubers and streamers like [MartinPonk](https://www.twitch.tv/martinponk), [Nems](https://www.youtube.com/user/NemsWorld) and [Goldawn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1r2mjZaIuAQaP0da2Zsjg).

I worked for them as a lead developer on Minecraft plugins and on their website.

I used lot of technologies like Kotlin, Java, PHP or JS/TS.
